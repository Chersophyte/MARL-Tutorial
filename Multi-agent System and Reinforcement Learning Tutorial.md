# Multi-agent System and Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

Our Tutorial is aimed to introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) background and RL application in Multi-agent system (coordination). We focus on cooperation in multiplayer stochastic games.

The tutorial covers main single agent reinforcement learning algorithms and some influential MARL frameworks.

Including:

1. Reinforcement Learning Interaction
2. Value-based RL
3. Policy-based RL
4. Actor-Critic
5. Multi-agent cooperative environment
6. Multi-agent Actor-Critic (MADDPG)
7. Multi-agent
